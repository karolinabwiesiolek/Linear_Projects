```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

```{r}
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate(
    stars = review_scores_location / 2
  ) |>
  rename(
    borough = neighbourhood_group
  ) |>
  filter(borough != "Staten Island") |>
  select(price, stars, borough, room_type, neighbourhood)
```



Do regression 
```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

do some additional cleaning
factor fct_infrequency --> organizing the variables in order in which they the most oftem appear 
```{r}
nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb |>
  mutate(
    borough = fct_infreq(borough),
    room_type = fct_infreq(room_type)
  )

fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)
```


Look at `lm` stuff:
```{r}
summary(fit)
```
